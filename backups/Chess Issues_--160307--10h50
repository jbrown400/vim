Issues:
-----------------------------------
1. Using deep copy
2. Using other pieces to block check (not working)
3. Attacking piece putting King in check (not working)
4. King trying to attack pieces who have their own kind who can attack the king
        if the king tries to take the piece.

Solutions:
-----------------------------------
1. Generate possible attack moves like I have been doing but instead
	of keeping a whole list of moves, make lists for each tile
	that contain all the possible pieces that move there. That way
	the king can move to the space if the list for that tile empty
